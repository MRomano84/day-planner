# day-planner

### My Task

Week 5's assignment for the UNH Coding Bootcamp is to design a simple workday scheduler that allows a user to save activities/todos throught their working day. It was required to include a library such as Moment.js to incorporate the current time using a web API. Of the 9 hours on the scheduler, past hours were supposed to be grey, the current hour is supposed to be red, and future hours are to be green.

### Day Planner

I decided to use Day.js to include the current time into my scheduler. I made a conditional to check if the current hour matched the 'H' pulled from Day.js and colored the corresponding rows accordingly. Unfortunately I was not able to save the user input in local storage and get it to persist.
